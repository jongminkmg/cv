## SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW
I am a developmental geneticist investigating mechanisms that block inappropriate transcription to direct cell type-specific gene expression. I am particularly interested in how compartmentalization of inactive (Polycomb-mediated) and active (CHD4-mediated) chromatin regions prevents spurious transcription. I aim to lead a lab that explores evolutionarily conserved repressive mechanisms safeguarding germ cell fate using flies and mice as model systems.

## SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW

I am a developmental geneticist investigating mechanisms that block inappropriate transcription. <br><br> The genome has numerous sites to initiate transcription, but a cell uses only a subset of those sites. I am interested in how chromatin structure and organization are modified to prevent spurious transcription. In particular, I investigate how a burst of testis-specific transcription in spermatocytes is tightly regulated by Polycomb and CHD4-Zinc finger protein complexes. My lab will explore the evolutionarily conserved repressive mechanisms safeguarding germ cell fate using flies and mice as model systems.<br><br>
